# Mission Management Middleware for Underwater Autonomous Vehicles (AUV)
This software is the mission management middleware solution implemented as part of the SWARMs architecture for the [SWARMs]((http://swarms.eu/)) [European research project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/662107/es).

It has three main components:
- The Missions and Tasks Reporter and Register and Reporter (MTRR), which is the main core for the mission management middleware.
- The Task Reporter, which is an auxiliary component for receiving and processing task progress information messages before delivering them to the MTRR.
- The Thrift Proxy, which is an auxiliary component to enable communications with the Mission Management Tool application via thrift.
